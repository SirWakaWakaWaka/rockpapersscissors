My first little piece of software

Hi there!


I started learning how to code last Tuesday (22nd Oct 2019). This is my first program after the initial "Hello World".


First you are asked for your name. If you enter nothing, it will prompt you again. Afterwards, it explains the rules and asks you for either Schere, Stein or Papier. It picks a random value of the three and compares it to your input. Then, it assigns points to the winner (draw is one point each). If your input is not one of the three values, it will tell you that your input is not valid and that you should try again.


I first tried to do it with switch instead of if (I had just read about switch in my book), but it didn't work right away, so I came up with this. The code is messy and cumbersome, but I'm glad it works.


translations for anyone not speaking German:

"Wie heisst du?" = "What's your name?"

"Du hast keinen Namen? Versuch es noch einmal." = "You don't have a name? Try again."

"Danke für's mitspielen," = "Thanks for playing,"

"Die Regeln sind wie folgt:" = "The rules are as follows:"

"Papier schlägt Stein" = "Paper beats rock"

"Stein schlägt Schere" = "Rock beats scissors"

"Schere schlägt Papier" = Scissors beat papier"

"Was wählst du?" = "What do you choose?"

"Unentschieden! Beide erhalten einen Punkt." = "Draw! Both get a point."

"Du verlierst! Computer erhält einen Punkt." = "You lose! Computer gets a point."

"Du gewinnst! {0} erhält einen Punkt" = "You win! {0} gets a point."

"Neuer Spielstand:" = "New score:"
